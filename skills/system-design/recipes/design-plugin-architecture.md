# Design Plugin Architecture Recipe

## Goal
Design a plugin-based architecture that enables extensibility while maintaining core system stability.

## Steps
1. Define plugin interfaces and contracts clearly.
2. Load plugins dynamically through a registry or factory.
3. Isolate plugin failures from the host application.
4. Validate plugin version compatibility and API stability.

## Focus Areas
- plugin interface design
- dynamic loading and registration
- error isolation
- compatibility checks

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
