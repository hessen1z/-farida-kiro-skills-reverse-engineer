# Event Dispatcher Example

## Overview
This example describes an event dispatcher that notifies registered listeners of events.

## Components
- `Event` payload structure.
- `EventDispatcher` class for registration and dispatch.
- Listener callbacks invoked when an event occurs.

## Notes
- Keep event handlers short and robust.
- Avoid blocking the dispatcher in synchronous dispatch loops.
- Use event filtering to reduce unrelated notifications.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
