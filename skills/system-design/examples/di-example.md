# Dependency Injection Example

## Overview
A simple example shows how constructor injection separates object creation from behavior.

## Components
- `ILogger` interface for logging.
- `FileLogger` concrete implementation.
- `Application` class that receives `ILogger` through its constructor.

## Notes
- Use interfaces for service contracts.
- Keep object lifetimes clear and avoid hidden dependencies.
- Facilitate unit testing by injecting mock implementations.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
