# Service Graph Patterns

## Overview
A service graph defines dependencies and startup order for modular system services.

## Patterns
- Represent services as nodes and dependencies as edges.
- Use topological sorting to initialize services in dependency order.
- Allow lazy initialization for optional or expensive services.

## Practical Workflow
1. Define services and their required dependencies.
2. Build a dependency graph at startup.
3. Initialize services in order, handling failures gracefully.
4. Shutdown services in reverse dependency order.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
