# Dependency Injection Patterns

## Overview
Dependency injection improves flexibility and testability by separating component construction from behavior.

## Patterns
- Provide dependencies through constructors or factory methods.
- Use abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
- Avoid service locators when explicit dependency wiring is possible.

## Practical Workflow
1. Define interfaces for core services.
2. Wire implementations at application startup.
3. Keep components unaware of concrete construction details.
4. Use DI to simplify unit testing and configuration.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
