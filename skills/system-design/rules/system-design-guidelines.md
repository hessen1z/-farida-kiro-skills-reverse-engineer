# System Design Guidelines

## Principles
- Design for modularity, maintainability, and clear ownership.
- Prefer explicit interfaces and avoid implicit global state.
- Keep components loosely coupled and highly cohesive.

## Rules
- Separate responsibilities and keep layer boundaries clear.
- Use dependency injection to reduce direct component coupling.
- Avoid cyclic dependencies and large monolithic subsystems.
- Document service contracts and initialization order.

## Analysis Rules
- Identify core services and ensure they have well-defined lifecycles.
- Treat shared mutable state as a risk for maintainability.
- Evaluate whether performance optimizations compromise code clarity.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
