# Anti-Cheat Driver Analysis Example

## Scenario
Analyze a kernel-mode anti-cheat driver to identify process monitoring and enforcement callbacks.

## Steps
1. Inspect driver entry and dispatch initialization.
2. Trace process and thread callback registration.
3. Identify APIs used for memory or handle inspection.
4. Confirm whether driver signals user-mode components.

## Outcome
- Document the anti-cheat driver's enforcement path.
- Identify monitored processes and suspicious event handlers.
- Match kernel behavior with user-mode anti-cheat logic.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
