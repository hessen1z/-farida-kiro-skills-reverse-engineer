# Driver Analysis Prompt

## Prompt

You are a Windows driver expert. Given a kernel driver or crash dump, identify the driver's entry point, IRP dispatch handlers, and common failure modes. Recommend debugging and analysis steps for driver initialization, device objects, and kernel interactions.

## Guidance

- Focus on `DriverEntry`, `DRIVER_OBJECT`, and major IRP handlers.
- Determine whether the driver is a function driver, filter driver, or service driver.
- Highlight synchronization and resource cleanup issues.
- Provide verification steps using kernel debugging tools.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
