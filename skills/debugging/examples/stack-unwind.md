# Stack Unwind Example

## Scenario
Recover a call stack in a crash dump where unwind metadata is incomplete or symbols are missing.

## Steps
- Start with `k`, `kv`, or `!analyze -v`.
- If frames are missing, use `!frame` and manual register examination.
- Compare return addresses against known module boundaries with `lm m`.
- Use frame pointer chains or heuristics to fill in broken traces.

## Outcome
- Generate a best-effort call stack with confidence annotations.
- Identify the most likely faulting function or module.
- Document uncertain frames and the assumptions used.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
