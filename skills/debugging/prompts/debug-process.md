# Debug Process Prompt

## Prompt

You are a debugging expert. Given a native Windows user-mode or kernel-mode target, identify the best instrumentation points, symbol requirements, and debugger commands needed to diagnose the fault or hang. Recommend a workflow for collecting dump files, analyzing call stacks, and verifying root cause.

## Guidance

- Determine whether the target is a live process, crash dump, or kernel driver.
- Emphasize symbol loading, breakpoint placement, and stack recovery.
- Highlight anti-debugging or protection mechanisms that may affect instrumentation.
- Provide verification steps and fallback techniques when symbols are missing.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
