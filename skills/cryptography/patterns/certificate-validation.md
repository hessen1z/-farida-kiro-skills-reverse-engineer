# Certificate Validation Patterns

## Overview
Certificate validation ensures that a public key belongs to a trusted identity.

## Patterns
- Build and validate the full certificate chain to a trusted root.
- Check certificate expiration, revocation, and intended usage.
- Use host name matching and subject alternative names where applicable.
- Reject self-signed or unverifiable certificates in security-sensitive contexts.

## Practical Workflow
1. Parse the certificate chain from the protocol or store.
2. Validate each certificates signature and trust path.
3. Confirm the certificate is valid for the target usage.
4. Check revocation status via OCSP or CRL if required.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
