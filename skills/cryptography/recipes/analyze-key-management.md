# Analyze Key Management Recipe

## Goal
Evaluate key lifecycle and protection controls for cryptographic assets.

## Steps
1. Identify where keys are generated, stored, and destroyed.
2. Confirm use of secure key storage or OS keystores.
3. Check whether keys are rotated or reused inappropriately.
4. Verify memory zeroization of sensitive key material.
5. Ensure key usage is limited to defined purposes.

## Focus Areas
- key generation quality
- storage and access controls
- rotation and expiration
- in-memory clearing

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
