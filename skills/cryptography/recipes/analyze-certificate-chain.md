# Analyze Certificate Chain Recipe

## Goal
Review certificate chain validation and trust decisions in authentication or secure transport.

## Steps
1. Extract certificates from the protocol or local store.
2. Build the chain from leaf to root and verify all signatures.
3. Confirm each certificates validity period and extension usage.
4. Check revocation status when required.
5. Validate usage constraints such as digital signature or key encipherment.

## Focus Areas
- chain construction
- issuer and subject relationships
- revocation and expiration
- usage constraints

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
