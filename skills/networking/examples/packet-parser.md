# Packet Parser Example

## Overview
This example shows a minimal parser for Ethernet, IPv4, and TCP headers. It illustrates how to safely inspect packet fields and classify payload data.

## Steps
1. Extract the Ethernet type to identify IP traffic.
2. Parse the IPv4 header and verify total length.
3. Parse the TCP header and compute the data offset.
4. Validate checksum and identify payload boundaries.

## Notes
- Always verify packet bounds before reading header fields.
- Handle different IP versions and extension headers.
- Do not assume packets are complete or aligned.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
