# Engine Discovery Example

## Scenario
Analyze a native game binary to determine its engine entry point, module relationships, and execution flow.

## Steps
1. Inspect the executable for engine-specific strings or module names.
2. Map imports and exported entry points to rendering, physics, or scripting.
3. Identify the main loop and initialization callbacks.
4. Trace how assets are loaded and game objects are created.

## Outcome
- Confirm whether the game uses a known engine or a custom runtime.
- Document the core engine modules and their responsibilities.
- Provide evidence for asset loader, renderer, and input subsystem locations.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
