# Plugin Discovery Example

## Scenario
Analyze a game engine to find dynamic plugin loading paths and module registration routines.

## Steps
1. Search for plugin folder strings or module names in the binary.
2. Identify loader functions that enumerate and load DLLs.
3. Trace registration callbacks into engine data structures.
4. Confirm plugin initialization order and lifetime.

## Outcome
- Determine how plugins are discovered and loaded.
- Document module handles and callback tables used by the engine.
- Identify any runtime checks applied to plugin modules.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
