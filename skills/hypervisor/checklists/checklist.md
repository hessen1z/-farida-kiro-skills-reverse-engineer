# Hypervisor Checklist

- [ ] Confirm whether Intel VT-x or AMD-V is enabled in firmware.
- [ ] Verify VMXON/SVM enablement and revision identifiers.
- [ ] Inspect VMCS/VMCB guest-state and host-state fields.
- [ ] Validate VM exit controls and expected exit reasons.
- [ ] Check EPT/NPT mappings and permission bits.
- [ ] Confirm secure kernel or VBS partition isolation.
- [ ] Verify synthetic interrupt and device virtualization behavior.
- [ ] Document any nested virtualization or VMCS shadowing implications.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
