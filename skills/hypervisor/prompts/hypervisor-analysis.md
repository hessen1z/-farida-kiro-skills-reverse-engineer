# Hypervisor Analysis Prompt

- Identify the virtualization extensions and hypervisor architecture in use.
- Explain the VMCS/VMCB layout and the VM exit conditions observed.
- Determine whether EPT/NPT translation or VM exit handling is the source of the issue.
- List the tools and commands required to inspect hypervisor state and guest transitions.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the core objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, and playbooks as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the advice grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result against the available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when this document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
