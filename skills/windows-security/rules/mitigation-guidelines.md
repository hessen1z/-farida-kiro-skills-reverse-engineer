# Windows Security Rules

## Rule: Verify Mitigation Claims
- Always confirm binary metadata against runtime enforcement.
- Do not assume a PE flag indicates mitigation without process-level validation.

## Rule: Respect Protected Processes
- Do not force debugging or dumping of protected processes.
- Use indirect analysis methods and document access restrictions.

## Rule: Treat Code Integrity as Gatekeeper
- If code integrity rejects a module, investigate signing and policy before attempting analysis.
- Code signing failures often indicate tampering, missing certificates, or incompatible policy.

## Rule: Match Analysis Scope to Protection Level
- Use user-mode tools for process mitigations and kernel-mode tools for driver integrity.
- Document which protections are hardware enforced, kernel enforced, or metadata only.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
