# Game Security Rules

## Rule 1: Evidence first
Investigate security behavior from observed runtime evidence before assuming protection intent.

## Rule 2: Preserve original state
Collect symbols, dumps, and snapshots before modifying protected memory or instrumentation.

## Rule 3: Separate detection from enforcement
Distinguish between anti-debug detection code and actual enforcement or crash behavior.

## Rule 4: Minimize instrumentation
Use non-invasive debugging when analyzing anti-cheat or anti-debug protections.

## Rule 5: Document boundaries
Capture module and component boundaries for security-sensitive code.

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
