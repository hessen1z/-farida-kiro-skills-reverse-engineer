# Example: Dear ImGui Dashboard

## Scenario
A desktop diagnostic dashboard needs a polished layout with a header, summary cards, scrollable content, and an action bar.

## Suggested Structure
- top header with title and actions
- summary cards with metrics and status tones
- tabbed content area
- side panel for logs or details
- footer status bar

## Implementation Notes
- use a consistent card widget for metrics
- use tables for logs and object lists
- use DrawList for accent panels and status indicators
- keep state management simple and centralized

## Practical Guidance

- Start from the concrete objective and define the expected outcome before applying the workflow.
- Use the related examples, recipes, playbooks, and references as the first implementation reference.
- Keep the guidance grounded in the surrounding skill context and verify the result with available evidence.
- Favor practical, maintainable steps over abstract theory when the document is used in real work.
## Verification Checklist

- Confirm that the main objective is clear and the workflow is actionable.
- Ensure the document points to the most relevant examples, recipes, or playbooks.
- Validate that the terminology is consistent with the rest of the skill.
- Check that the practical guidance is specific enough to be used without further interpretation.
